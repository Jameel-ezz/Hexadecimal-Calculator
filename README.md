# HexadecimalCalculator
 The provided code represents a microcontroller-based hexadecimal calculator with an LCD display.
This calculator takes two hexadecimal numbers as input and allows the user to perform bitwise logical operations,
such as AND, OR, XOR, and NOR. The keypad connected to the microcontroller is used to input the hexadecimal numbers 
and select the desired operation. The LCD screen displays the entered numbers, 
the selected operator, and the result of the chosen operation.

The code continuously loops, allowing the user to perform multiple calculations without the need to restart the calculator. 
The simplicity and interactivity of the microcontroller-based hexadecimal calculator make it useful for quick bitwise operations 
on hexadecimal numbers.
